# OpenNote History

Back in 2013 OneNote was started. Back then Microsoft OneNote did not have a full featured web interface. I used that at the time and had many notebooks. I wanted a way of taking those notes with me on my phone. I had limited data and wanted an application that would sync all my notes, let me modify them, and sync them back. I tried a bunch of applications and there were none that fulfilled my offline and tree structure requirements.

## Open note
OpenNote has a text only design. No icons or symbols other than ascii non alphabetical characters. The application just so happened to end up this way. It has a very clean feel to it and does not distract you. I would like to keep this going forward.

**Why emphasis on text?** Text is a really old medium for storing information. All sorts of style and support for it. Computers store text really efficiently in comparison to blob data like images.


### OpenNote Generations
#### Generation Alpha
The first version of OpenNote was a PHP fat application. Views were prepared by PHP and sent to the browser via a full load or AJAX.

#### Generation Beta
Second major revision was the switch to the then booming Angular 1 framework and use HTML5 application manifest and CouchDB to provided offline access and syncing.

#### Current Generation
The most recent efforts have been to add modern features. Tags, markdown, and a CLI.
